What ends up getting copied is folders like `for-latest-build` and `for-Tiramisu-build` which, down the line, contain a zip that needs to be extracted and replace the contents of the `current` folder.\n\nWe also only need this for certain modules, at least as of last testing, if \"need\" as defined as \"it won\u0027t build without these\" or \"the OS seems to work with just these\".",
